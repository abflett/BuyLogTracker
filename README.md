# BuyLogTracker

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this back-end development project, inspired by IAmTimCory's YouTube content, is to design and implement a robust system for capturing and managing purchase data from users. The project revolves around creating and updating user records, which include their name, phone number, and an optional email address. Data integrity and efficient retrieval of user-related purchase information are core priorities.

**Project Types:**

- **Data Management:** The project focuses on data management, including the creation, update, and retrieval of user and purchase history records.
- **API Development:** It involves building an API to facilitate interactions with the database, allowing users to create, update, and query user and purchase history data.

**Use Cases:**

1. **User Creation:** Users can be created with essential information, such as their name and phone number. An optional email address can also be included.
2. **Adding Purchase History:** Users can add purchase history entries, specifying a description of the purchase. This feature ensures that a user's purchase history is tracked accurately.
3. **Data Integrity:** The system is designed to ensure data integrity by checking for duplicate users and updating their records instead of creating duplicates.
4. **Querying Users:** The application offers query capabilities to retrieve user records based on name, phone number, or purchase history descriptions.
5. **User Details:** Users can access their purchase history and detailed information through a user ID.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET (version 8)
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Data Access:** Entity Framework Core
- **API Development:** ASP.NET Core
- **Validation:** Data annotations for input validation
- **Code Organization:** Repositories, Services, and Controllers for a structured architecture

**Project Context:**
This project is designed to meet the challenge requirements, emphasizing efficient data management and user interaction. It showcases skills in back-end development, API design, data modeling, and database interaction using popular .NET technologies.
